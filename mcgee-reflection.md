# What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I felt pretty confident in the Git concepts except for fetching. For some reason it wasn't clicking for me. 

# What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The main concept that was clarified during the GPS was the fetch/merge process. I had been struggling with fetching and merging, and didn't quite understand what was going on. Watching my pair do a git fetch/merge really helped, along with our guide explaining what was happening during each command. Understanding that pull command is essentially just fetching and merging in one step really helped clarify what was happening. It helped tremendously. 

# What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I felt pretty comfortable with the git/github process before the GPS, but the main area I had questions on was fetching as mentioned above. 

# What still confuses you about Git?
I feel like I understand the process pretty well. I have run into a few pull request issues in my own practicing, so I still have much to learn but after the GPS I feel pretty good about my Git knowledge up to this point.

# How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was awesome. I learned a lot. I felt very comfortable with my Jim and Matthew. I would enjoy pairing with them both again. It's also a nice reminder that we are all learning this together, so there's no reason to be frustrated when something doesn't immediately make sense.
