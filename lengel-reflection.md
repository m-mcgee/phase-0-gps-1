# What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was struggling with: git fetch, git merge, and git pull

# What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The above 3 concepts were clarified significantly during the GPS.

# What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked my guide about when to clean up old branches and how to use git pull. Also, what origin/master meant in a fetch.

# What still confuses you about Git?

Functionally, I feel like I can do whatever I need to do. I am still a bit fuzzy on precisely what is happening, but at least I know how to use the commands properly.

# How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I was nervous beforehand, but Matt was a great guide and my pair (Matt McGee) was great, too. I learned much more in this session than I would have learned on my own.
